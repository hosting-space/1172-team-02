            They are ingrained in training, based on self-study and inspired by verity and opportunity. We are committed
            to our passion for asana, kirtan, and spiritual teachings all in one place, in a friendly and supportive

            We view connection with each other in this amazing adventure as a way to a deeper connection with ourselves,
            and everything weâ€™ve done to help promote those connections. We achieve this through slow movements,
            relaxing music, and stillness.
